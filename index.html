        <p>I recieved a job offer mid- <br> course, and the subjects I <br> learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>

        <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I sugned up for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</q>

        <q>I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I've made in myself</q>

        <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experience was easy.</p>
        <q>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people</q>

        <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <q>Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was enocouraged to enroll by a former student of their who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile time project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</q>
